# ReactiveAPIUsingWebFlux

This repo will help people to learn basics of ReactiveAPI using webFlux. 

As we know Imperative APIs are generally calls an API and waits till it gets all the data more or less it's a Synchronous & Blocking Process . 
In opposite Reactive APIs calls an API and renders the data on the go so it's clearly asynchronous & Non-blocking Process . 

We have below concepts to acheive the same 

1. Flux (which sends 0 or N elements to the User) We can use this feature when requesting users orders , inventory ...
2. Mono (Which sends 1 element to the User) We can use this feature when authenticating user as we are expecting only one record should present
